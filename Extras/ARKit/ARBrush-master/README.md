# ARBrush
Quick demo of 3d drawing in ARKit using metal + SceneKit. 

Code adapted from:
  https://github.com/lapfelix/ARKit-line-drawing 
and:
  https://www.raywenderlich.com/146414/metal-tutorial-swift-3-part-1-getting-started

NOTE: This is experimental code! ..I'm just learning swift.

Also note: this demo is pretty trivial to accomplish in Unity with the ARKit plugin (https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/arkit-support-for-ios-via-unity-arkit-plugin.474385/  https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/92515 ). This demo was more to see if metal drawing could be layered on top of scenekit.
